/**
 * The strongest lane tui-idle-evidence.ts trusts to say an agent's TUI is at rest:
 * - `hook-done`: its own hook reports the lead turn ended (DSH).
 * - `synthetic-title`: its hooks drive an Orca-written `<Agent> ready` title.
 * - `title`: its running process names itself in a title the status classifier reads.
 * - `ready-body`: a ready screen Orca recognises (Muse; Qoder, whose idle title can show while
 *   its trust menu still owns input).
 * - `none`: no stronger lane, so a quiet foreground process is its only one. Hooks or a first-party
 *   `done` (amp, kimi, command-code, freebuff) do not count: tui-idle takes their `working` as a
 *   veto, and trusts a first-party `done` only from DSH.
