//
// The rest are excluded, recorded here because the UI deliberately won't say
// why (a provider's storage layout is Orca's problem, not the reader's):
// - antigravity, kimi: a separate registry (history.jsonl / session_index.jsonl)
//   would keep a dangling entry. Antigravity's carries no conversation id, so
//   which line to drop can't be determined at all.
// - codex: session_index.jsonl plus hardlink aliases between the Orca-managed
//   home and ~/.codex, so a one-sided delete reappears on the next scan.
// - opencode 1.17.x: a SQLite row, not a file.
