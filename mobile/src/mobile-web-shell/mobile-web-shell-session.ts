 * `reconnecting` is unreachable, not connecting, and that is the whole point of the distinction: a
 * host whose desktop is gone never settles on `disconnected`. The client dials, fails, schedules a
 * retry and cycles `connecting` -> `reconnecting` -> `connecting` with the delay growing to a
 * minute, so treating `reconnecting` as "still dialling" leaves a phone with a perfectly good
 * cached workspace spinning forever. `connecting` alone is the first dial, which is worth the wait
 * because it usually succeeds; a scheduled retry after a failure is evidence the host is not there.
