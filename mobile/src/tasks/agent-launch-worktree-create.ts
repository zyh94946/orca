 * Issuing a mobile workspace create through `agent.launch` rather than `worktree.create`.
 *
 * `worktree.create` + `startupAgent` means "create the worktree agent-first": its startup terminal
 * IS the agent, so the structured branch below it is unreachable. That is why picking an agent on
 * the mobile create sheet always produced a PTY while the in-workspace "+" button produced a chat.
 * `agent.launch` carries the same create payload but lets the host settle the surface, so both
 * mobile entry points route the same way.
 *
 * The request is built from the caller's existing `worktree.create` params so the fallback path
 * stays byte-identical; the reserved agent fields are stripped here with the shared helper the
 * host applies anyway.
