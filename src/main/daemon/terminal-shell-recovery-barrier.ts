 * pauses at that exact byte boundary, the execution host proves the shell owns
 * the PTY foreground, and on proof a mode reset is injected as in-stream output
 * so every downstream consumer (host emulator, mirrors, attached renderers,
 * history) converges — and the queued shell prompt then paints onto the normal
 * buffer instead of the discarded alternate screen. Any failure (refuted proof,
 * timeout, overflow, death, disposal) flushes the queue unmodified, preserving
