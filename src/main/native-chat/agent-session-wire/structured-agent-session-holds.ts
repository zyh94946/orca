// The lifetime of a structured session, tied to the surfaces that want one.
//
// Nothing used to tell the host that a chat WANTED a session, and nothing told it when a chat
// stopped wanting one. Both halves of that gap cost real processes: sessions nobody had opened got
// an app-server at every launch, and sessions the user closed kept theirs until the app quit.
//
// A surface takes a hold when it binds and drops it when it goes away. The first hold on a session
// with no child resumes it — that, and not the shape of a lease on disk, is what makes a provider
// process exist. The last hold leaving starts the idle release clock. Transport close is the BACKSTOP,
// not the mechanism: a client that vanishes mid-flight never sends its release, so the caller
// registers one against the connection and the holder set absorbs the duplicate.
//
// A send to a childless session resumes it too, and so does provider-exit recovery under an open
// surface. All three go through `ensureProviderChild` inside the session's serialize, so they take
// turns: the first to run attaches, and the next finds the child and attaches nothing. Two attaches
// for one session would race against the same released fence, and the loser's stale fence refused
// it — a hold that lost dropped its holder, a send that lost was refused.
