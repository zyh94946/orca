/**
 * Ranking the evidence that a `tui-idle` wait may settle on.
 *
 * Why a ranking: a thinking TUI and a finished TUI are both silent, so the absence
 * of a working marker can never prove completion. `detectAgentStatusFromTitle`
 * DEFAULTS a name-only agent title to `idle` — the sidebar needs that to clear a
 * stale spinner (#1437) — so a busy Codex/Devin pane is routinely titled idle, and
 * accepting it satisfied a wait in ~0s mid-turn (#6011).
 *
 *   0. BLOCKED — the tail shows a prompt waiting on the user.
 *   1. STRONG READY — the agent states it is ready: an explicit idle marker in its own
 *      title, or a known ready-prompt body.
 *   1b. QUIET READY SCREEN — Muse and an idle Codex title no rest signal, so their
 *      ready-screen body stands in for the strong evidence, believed only once quiet.
 *   2. WORKING — a fresh first-party agent status (OSC 9999) saying working/blocked/
 *      waiting, or a working title. The agent's own account of itself outranks anything
 *      inferred.
 *   3. WEAK READY — a name-only title, or a quiet non-shell foreground process. A last
 *      resort, and only once sustained.
 *
 * Why weak ready is a verdict class rather than a per-evidence flag: none of it can see a
 * start-up dialog the line tail lost (Claude's workspace trust), so ONLY the poll may settle
 * on it, after the rendered screen shows no blocker. Synchronous sites settle on tiers 0-1b.
 *
 * Why derived here rather than stamped onto the record at write time: `syncWindowGraph`
 * rebuilds every leaf from an explicit field list, so a bespoke provenance field is
 * silently dropped on any renderer publish and the verdict silently flips. `lastOscTitle`
 * is copied, so reading the rank back off it cannot decay.

 * composer until its timeout.
 *
 * Why a hook `done` is trustworthy here where a title would not be: it is the agent's own
 * account of its own turn, and `normalizeDshEvent` drops SubagentStart/SubagentStop, so a
 * `done` row for a DSH pane is the LEAD's, never a child's finishing early.
