// of the contract and nothing about Codex's. The behavior Orca actually depends on
// lives in the Codex binary — a read of an unindexed rollout performs a read-repair
// that inserts the `threads` row. If Codex ever dropped that repair, the stub-driven
// tests would all stay green while the subsystem went silently inert. This is the
// real-binary backstop, built to the same shape as the Git binary compatibility
// contract in src/shared/git-binary-compatibility.test.ts.
//
// Keep it narrow. It pins the arms that ablation established Orca relies on,
// and deliberately asserts nothing else about the app-server, so an unrelated Codex
// release does not redden it into being disabled.
