/**
 * Guard the spawn chokepoint at the tree level rather than per call site.
 *
 * Six decisions have to be made every time Orca starts a child process, and
 * Windows punishes each of them differently. Made per-call-site they were right
 * in some files and wrong in others. `run-process.ts` makes them once; this
 * test is what stops the 174th file from making them again.
 *
 * The allowlist only shrinks. A new direct import fails here even if it happens
 * to be correct today, because "correct today" is exactly what the wrong files
 * also were before someone copied them.
