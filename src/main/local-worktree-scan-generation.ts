/**
 * Advances on every event above that can change what a worktree scan would find — repo add,
 * removal, update, and scan-cache invalidation — and on nothing else. A cache that must not answer
 * for repos it never saw compares this in O(1) instead of walking the repo list.
 *
 * Why not `generationSequence`: that also advances when `getLocalWorktreeScanGeneration` mints a key
 * for a repo id nothing has scanned yet, which is a read. Keying a snapshot on it would let a read
 * path discard a snapshot that is still perfectly valid.
 *
 * Ordering-only: the value means nothing outside a same-process comparison.
