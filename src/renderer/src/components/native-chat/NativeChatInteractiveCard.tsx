/**
 * Render the pane's interactive card (see useNativeChatInteractivePromptCard): a
 * question wizard or a tool approval. Cleared by the host once the agent moves
 * on, so it disappears automatically. Sends through the composer's verified
 * runtime path (R8/R6): answers via agent-specific paste or selector
 * keystrokes; cancel/deny as ESC.
 * Guarded by `canSend` so a mobile presence-lock blocks desktop sends too.
 *
 * Dismiss-on-answer (mobile parity): the live status lingers after answering —
 * the agent emits a post-tool event carrying the same prompt — so we track the
 * answered prompt by content key and hide the card until a genuinely different
 * prompt arrives. The dismissal resets once the prompt clears, so a later
 * (even identical) prompt shows again instead of staying hidden.
