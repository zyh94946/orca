/**
 * The hybrid shell route, dark behind a development-only flag.
 *
 * One of the two callers of `useMobileWebShellEnabled`. With the flag off — which is every store build,
 * since the only writer is the `__DEV__` Troubleshoot toggle — this redirects and the screen is
 * never constructed, so nothing is fetched, written or swept. It sits under `app/h/[hostId]` so
 * `HostProtocolGate` in that group's layout still owns the `desktop-too-old` wall above it.
 *
 * Reachable by deep link and from the developer row only; no screen links here.
