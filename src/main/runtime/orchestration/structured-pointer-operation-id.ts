/**
 * The agent-session operation id one structured worker mailbox's pointer send runs under.
 *
 * Orchestration's own `msg_<hex>` ids do not match the host's `^\d{13}-[0-9a-f]{32}$` shape and are
 * refused before the first send, so the id is minted here instead. It is durable and reused across
 * retries, because the id IS the send's idempotency key: a fresh id for the same nudge would land
 * as a second turn, and the host replays a recorded id's verdict without reaching the provider, so
 * a retry after a failed send starts nothing. It is re-minted only when the send is genuinely a
 * different call: a different batch of mail or session, or one the journal shows is owed again
 * (see `decideStructuredPointerAttempt`). Age never re-mints a send the host recorded: its verdict
 * is the only evidence of whether the nudge landed.
 *
 * Reuse is keyed on the MESSAGE IDS in the batch, never on the pointer body: the body names only
 * how many messages are waiting, so two unrelated same-size batches share a fingerprint. Reusing a
 * live id across them makes the host answer from its operation ledger — `accepted`, with no turn
 * sent — and this lane then marks the new mail delivered. That is silent mail loss.

 * - `mint`: a new send. The batch or session changed; the agent ran a turn after the row was
 *   minted; an earlier process minted it, so its attempt died with that process; or the host never
 *   recorded it and would now refuse it as too old to admit.
 * - `reuse`: resend under the row's id. Unrecorded, it is a first delivery; recorded as failed, the
 *   host replays that verdict and starts nothing, so a provider that dies on every turn is not
 *   restarted by every status edge, and a user's Stop stays stopped.
