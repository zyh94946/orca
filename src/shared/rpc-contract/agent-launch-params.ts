/**
 * The wire shape of `agent.launch`, mirroring `AgentLaunchIntent`.
 *
 * A caller states WHERE the agent lands and WHAT it should say; it never names a mode. There is
 * deliberately no `structured` / `terminal` field and no startup-agent field on the create
 * payload — the host decides, and `withoutReservedAgentCreateFields` strips a stale one out of a
 * payload a caller migrated over from `worktree.create`.
 *
 * Shared rather than main-side because every field resolves to a shared schema: a remote client
 * that sends this method needs `RpcSendParams<'agent.launch'>` to exist, and a method missing from
 * the catalog can only be sent through the raw request port.
