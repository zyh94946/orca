// The host's answer to "a turn just finished", derived once per journal commit.
//
// WHY THE HOST DERIVES IT: a structured session runs on the execution host and keeps journalling
// whether or not any renderer has a reader mounted. A client that derived completions itself would
// see none for a backgrounded chat — which is the case this exists to serve.
//
// WHY IT IS LIVE-ONLY: nothing here is retained, replayed or queued. A subscriber learns what
// finishes while it is subscribed and nothing else. That is the deliberate opposite of the status
// feed next door, which replays every session on subscribe: a status is state a late reader still
// needs, a completion is an edge that has already passed. Keeping a queue would create a durable
// obligation with nothing to retire it.
