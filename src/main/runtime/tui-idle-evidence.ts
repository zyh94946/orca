/**
 * Ranking the evidence that a `tui-idle` wait may settle on.
 *
 * Why a ranking: a thinking TUI and a finished TUI are both silent, so the absence
 * of a working marker can never prove completion. `detectAgentStatusFromTitle`
 * DEFAULTS a name-only agent title to `idle` — the sidebar needs that to clear a
 * stale spinner (#1437) — so a busy Codex/Devin pane is routinely titled idle, and
 * accepting it satisfied a wait in ~0s mid-turn (#6011).
 *
 *   1. POSITIVE — the agent states it is ready: an explicit idle marker in its own
 *      title, or a known ready-prompt body.
 *   1b. MUSE — Muse emits no title signal at all, so its ready-screen body stands in
 *      for the positive evidence, believed only once the stream has gone quiet.
 *   2. VETO — a fresh first-party agent status (OSC 9999) saying working/blocked/
 *      waiting. The agent's own account of itself outranks anything inferred.
 *   3. ABSENCE — a name-only title, or a quiet non-shell foreground process. A last
 *      resort, and only once sustained.
 *
 * Why derived here rather than stamped onto the record at write time: `syncWindowGraph`
 * rebuilds every leaf from an explicit field list, so a bespoke provenance field is
 * silently dropped on any renderer publish and the verdict silently flips. `lastOscTitle`
 * is copied, so reading the rank back off it cannot decay.
