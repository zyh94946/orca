/**
 * Why every PTY site delivers this payload as `-EncodedCommand` and keeps doing so.
 *
 * An MDE report named the base64 a contributing "suspicious PowerShell" signal and
 * pointed at VS Code as the counter-example. VS Code and its forks actually ship
 * `["-noexit","-command",'try { . "{0}\\...\\shellIntegration.ps1" } catch {}']` -- a
 * one-liner that dot-sources a *file*, not inline script. Dot-sourcing is
 * execution-policy gated; inline text is not. Measured on Windows 11:
 *
 *   policy        dot-source .ps1   -Command inline   -EncodedCommand
 *   Restricted    blocked           runs              runs
 *   AllSigned     blocked           runs              runs
 *   RemoteSigned  runs              runs              runs
 *
 * So VS Code's shape silently drops OSC 133 -- and with it foreground-process and
 * exit-code tracking -- on exactly the locked-down fleets MDE runs on; its `catch {}`
 * is that failure being swallowed.
 *
 * Inline `-Command` does carry this payload intact through node-pty/ConPTY (verified
 * on powershell.exe 5.1 and pwsh 7.6.5), so the switch is feasible; it is declined
 * because it costs more signal than it removes. No PTY site spells `-ExecutionPolicy
 * Bypass`, so base64 is the whole of what would go, and AMSI and script-block logging
 * decode it anyway -- nothing is hidden from MDE today. What would change is the
 * process command line, which would then carry `$ExecutionContext.SessionState.
 * LanguageMode`, a `function Global:prompt` override and `[char]27`-assembled control
 * sequences in clear text: higher-signal for command-line heuristics than an opaque
 * token with no `Bypass` beside it.
 *
 * The payload is also not static -- providers/windows-shell-args.ts appends the PTY
 * cwd and the queued startup command. #7978 had to move cmd.exe startup commands off
 * `/K` to stdin because node-pty's argv escaping mangled their quotes; PowerShell
 * never needed that workaround, because `-EncodedCommand` is quoting-proof.
