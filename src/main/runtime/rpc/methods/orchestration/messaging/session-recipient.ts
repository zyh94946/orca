/**
 * An agent session named as a recipient: `session:<id>`, or a bare Orca session id. Any session on
 * this host can be addressed, not only one that coordinates a Run: an agent's id is its public
 * address, and a user telling one agent to message another's id is a supported workflow.
 *
 * Mail that no Run or Dispatch owns is stored at the conversation's `session:<root id>` and pointed
 * at its live session as a turn, so any session of a `/clear` lineage is a valid spelling. A
 * released lease is not a refusal (the pointer's send starts its agent); a closed chat, another host,
 * and an unknown id are, before anything is stored.
