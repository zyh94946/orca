// Which durable teardown witnesses are still offers.
//
// The marker IS the answer to "was this chat working" AND the description of what it was doing:
// teardown took both from the same check the sidebar shows, right before the chat's child was
// stopped. Nothing here re-reads the journal to second-guess it — once reattached, a provider
// rewrites that journal in its own words (a notice turn of its own, restated subagent rows, a
// restored thread), and every reading of those rewrites as "the work is done" dropped chats that
// were owed a resume.
//
// An offer ends only by the user's own actions. The ones this predicate can see — a newer message
// of theirs in that chat, or the conversation forked — are reported back as `superseded` so the
// caller DELETES the record rather than filtering it forever. What remains are structural checks
// that are not about work at all: the record still exists and this build supports it, and the
// lease is free.
