// What a restart owes a persisted session, and what it does NOT.
//
// It owes reconciliation — every lease loaded from disk names an owner from a process generation
// that no longer exists, and adjudicating that is startup's job. It owes an exit from any recovery
// stage the evidence now permits. And it owes a READABLE session: the journal open, history
// answerable, the tab restorable.
//
// It does not owe a provider child. This used to resume every record whose lease was `released`,
// which is the normal end state of a chat the user closed cleanly — so a
// healthy profile started an app-server per session it had ever used, in parallel, at every launch,
// with no client attached and nothing on screen. A child now exists because a surface asked for the
// session (see `structured-agent-session-holds`), not because a record survived on disk.
